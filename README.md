Learn about Economic Order Quantity by selling Hot Dogs

This short little text-based game was made as a final project for my Industrial Systems Engineering class. 
I took an in-class activity we used to learn about economic order quantity and recreated it in python.
It could definitely be improved upon some, but it's not too bad for something I did in less than a day!
(Also, I'm a beginner at coding, so have mercy on my soul)

Anyways, I tried to make the code pretty customizable so that you can edit it however you like. I even added a sandbox option for messing around!
...that being said, though, I haven't figured out how to do custom dice in python yet, at least not in a way that can yield a probability table.
So, if you feel like getting funky with the dice, just use anydice.com's "At Most" table.
Have fun! Or don't, I'm not your boss!
